			<h1>Overview</h1>
			<p class="e-dropcap">Solving Public Problems with Technology is a hands-on learning and mentoring program designed to help you design and implement solutions to public interest problems using civic technology. The course enables you to take advantage of the latest innovations in open and participatory problem-solving, including the application of open data, crowdsourcing, expert networks, expert systems, challenges, and prizes. Geared to the purpose-driven participant (both individuals and teams, whether in grad school or on the job) passionate about a public problem, <i>Solving Public Problems</i> helps you develop a  project from idea to implementation. Unlike a traditional accelerator, we focus only on the public interest and on projects that work with real world institutions and partners, such as agencies and NGOs, to develop more effective and scalable initiatives.</p>
			<ul>
				<h3>The program combines:</h3>
				<li>Original videos and curated readings about open government and civic technology </li>
				<li>Online discussions and skill-building with diverse peers and coaches</li>
				<li>Connection to a network of subject-matter mentors and experts</li>
				<li>Opportunity to hone and develop project materials through personalized feedback at every stage of an agile design process</li>
				<li>Frequent and constructive feedback opportunities from a team of teachers and peers</li>
				
				<h3>Through intensive coaching, rapid prototyping, collaboration and presentation, you will</h3>
				<li>Learn about the latest civic tech innovations and how to apply them to develop effective solutions</li>
				<li>Learn how to use new technologies to structure, track and manage your progress</li>
				<li>Learn how to find expertise that can help develop an actionable strategy</li>
				<li>Apply human-centered design to understand the desired user experience</li>
				<li>Precisely define the problem you want to address</li>
				<li>Map the solution space and the current state of practice</li>
				<li>Develop key skills for implementing projects in real world institutions (including how to craft concise memos, pinpoint and overcome legal barriers, pitch projects to risk-adverse officials and politicians, and identify whom to convene to get stuff done)</li>
				<li>Join a growing network of likeminded peers</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The program is available for credit at NYU, MIT Media Lab, and <a href="http://www.asu.edu">Arizona State University</a>. Non-credit online participants who complete the program receive an authenticated Certificate and Badge. For successful participants the program will serve as a gateway to  opportunities to compete for a range of Fellowship and funding opportunities, including from the Knight Foundation, the D-Prize, GovLab and more.</p>

			<p>Each week combines learning about the substance of open government and civic tech innovation with skill building and activities designed to catalyze project development</p>

			<p class="b-box">Weeks alternate between <strong>Workshops</strong> and <strong>small-group</strong>, <strong>online Discussions</strong>. <br>All lectures, videos and readings are online and listed on the Before Class sections of this syllabus.</p>

			<p class="b-alone"><strong>Before Class</strong> - Every week approximately 30-60 minutes of videos and reading materials will be curated on the relevant theme and will be freely available online. The program is ‘flipped class’, which means that you consume content individually, leaving class time free to workshop projects.
			<p class="b-workshop"><strong>All-Group Workshops</strong> <em>(Location: In-person and online for non-credit participants)</em> - Approximately every other week, the NYC and Cambridge participants meet for workshops, which will last up to 3 hours. For-credit participants will be expected to attend all of these sessions in person. Non-credit participants will join live group sessions via Google Unhangout platform. You are also welcome to attend in person, space permitting. There will be 8 of these sessions.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>New York Edition - Thursdays, Times 6:30 to 9:30 pm ITP, 721 Broadway Floor 4, New York, NY</li>
				<li>Cambridge Edition - Wednesdays from 11:00 am to 1:00 pm in E14-493</li>
				<li>Unhangouts - will enable non-credit participants to join these classes remotely. More about the platform here.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="b-discussion"><strong>Small Group Discussions</strong> <em>(Location: Online using Unhangout Platform)</em>  - Alternating weeks, we meet in live, small groups to discuss readings and do a group exercise designed to help us apply what we are learning about civic tech to the design of our own projects. Participants are organized into groups based on mutual availability. Members of the teaching staff moderate and participate in these live discussions. There will be 5 of these sessions, offered at a choice of times, including the usual classtime.</p>

			<p class="b-pod"><strong>Learning PODS</strong> <em>(Location: Online)</em> - Every participating individual/team also belongs to a learning and coaching POD, which are small groups of participants across campuses with diverse skills yet working on projects with a similar theme. Your POD is your core support group. You will do practices pitches with them, share what you are learning and commiserate about the ups and downs of your project. There will be 3 POD pitch sessions plus informal collaboration.</p>

			<p><strong>Optional Q&amp;As with experts and insiders:</strong> <em>(Location: Live and Online)</em> - Conversations with transformational game changers about how they designed and implemented their projects. These will be scheduled in response to demand from participants.</p>

					<p class="b-workshop"><strong>All-Group Workshop</strong> - In this workshop, we delve into different approaches to crowdsourcing and to crowdsourcing smartly using expert networking to target relevant audiences. We use the workshop to apply open and collaborative approaches to tackling your challenges and focus on identifying the audiences you want to participate and how to engage them. We work through an exercise of designing a crowdsourced approach for smarter policymaking for the White House.</p>

					<p><em>After the workshop:</em></p>
					<p><strong>Post:</strong> Do a blog post on how the study cases offered to you by the advisor may be applicable to what you are looking to achieve and if and how you decide to use crowdsourcing as a tool for your project. Consider a) how will you incentivize your crowd for participation (your previously developed personae); b) how will you control the quality of the crowd participation, and; c) through wich communication technology or platform will your crowd participate.</p>

					<p><strong>Ask an expert:</strong> With the help of the teaching team, schedule a meeting / call / skype about your project. The goal is to identify other projects and potential collaborators focused on the same problem.</p>

In this week’s small group discussions, the goal is to understand big, small and open data and to identify how data-led approaches might apply to your own projects. In a group exercise working with Public Labs, you will consider how data could be used to ameliorate a contemporary challenge and, at your option, get out and learn how to do some balloon mapping, layering the data you collect onto a map.</p>

					<p><em>After the discussion:</em></p>
					<p>Post a blog which summarizes the results of the exercise and identifies options for using data in your own project.</p>

					<p class="b-discussion"><strong>Discussion</strong> - You will learn how to carry out an initial field scan of academic literature, social media and other sources and learn from pros about both in-depth and quick techniques for getting smarter about your field and who is in it. Learning with librarians, you will identify key data sets, primary and secondary resources and the key data points you will need to make a persuasive case for your problem.</p> 

					<p><em>After the discussion:</em></p>
					<p><strong>Create a map of your issue</strong> - do your own literature review and use the tools you have been learned to create a map identifying the key actors, policies and events (past and future) interacting with issue. Create a <a href="http://paper.li/" target="_blank">Paper.li</a> for your project to stay on top of developments in the field.</p>

					<p><strong>Do:</strong> submit a 'state of the issue' map, a summary of your literature review and a directory of the key people in the field.</p>

					<p>Have you tweeted about your project? Blogged? Discussed with friends? Met with mentors and experts?</p>

When does avoiding such collaboration increase the likelihood of success? Do I start my own or do I collaborate? Whom do I have to convince to do what to achieve my goals?</p>

				<p class="e-faq-question">What is Solving Problems with Technology?</p>
				<p class="e-faq-answer">Solving Public Problems with Technology is a hands-on learning and mentoring program designed to help you design and implement solutions to public interest problems using civic technology. The course enables you to take advantage of the latest innovations in open and participatory problem-solving, including the application of open data, crowdsourcing, expert networks, expert systems, challenges, and prizes. Geared to the purpose-driven participant (both individuals and teams, whether in grad school or on the job) passionate about a public problem, <i>Solving Public Problems</i> helps you develop a  project from idea to implementation. Unlike a traditional accelerator, we focus only on the public interest and on projects that work with real world institutions and partners, such as agencies and NGOs, to develop more effective and scalable initiatives.</p>

					<li>Time and energy to commit to the program activities.</li>
					<li>The drive to do what it takes to develop a real-world initiative with the potential to impact people and communities. Keep in mind that the way to have the greatest impact might not involve building an app or creating a new non-profit but collaborating with others. </li>

			<div class="b-faq">
				<p class="e-faq-question">This Looks Like a Lot of Work?</p>
				<p class="e-faq-answer">It is. This is not a simulation but an opportunity to get a real civic tech project closer to implementation. A lot of work will need to get done outside the classroom, including user interviews and background research. Although we take account of the fact that people have other jobs and classes, this is a lot of work but in connection with your passions!</p>
